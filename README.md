ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @IngEdgar7500
ðŸŽ“ Electrical-Electronic Engineer | UNAM - FES AragÃ³n ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½
ðŸ’» I enjoy programming in **Python** and **C++**  
ðŸš€ My favorite microcontroller is the **ESP32**

## ðŸ”§ What you'll find in my repositories:

- Code examples for **ESP32** projects  
- Electrical diagrams using **sensors**, **modules**,**relays**,  and  **microcontrollers**
- Complete descriptions of **functional  systems**

## ðŸ¤– Bridging hardware and software

I combine electronics and programming to automate, control, and monitor real-world systems. My goal is to build practical solutions and share them clearly for other developers and enthusiasts.
